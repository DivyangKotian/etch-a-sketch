# etch-a-sketch
Etch a sketch with HTML, CSS and JS.

Funtionality-
    - Can create a custom grid of upto 64*64
    - Can choose any static color plus use colorpicker to set pen color
    - Rainbow mode- Random color generated for the pen
    - Eraser

Limitations
    - Grid resets everytime you change size
    - No shading mode yet.
    - Since I was following the instructions from The Odin project, i avoided using CSS grid techniques, this made rainbowmode change on every pixel the mouse moved instead of everycell. If i get the time I plan on rewriting this with CSS grid so it will be easier to implement shading as well
    
Feature ideas to implement
    -Clear canvas (easy add)
    -Save images.
    -Export images.
    -Undo tool.
    -Shading, both lighten and darken modes

This project really helped me experiment and have fun with a lot of DOM manipulation techniques,
